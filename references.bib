  abstract = {This study focuses on comparing the different supervised machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Multilayer Perceptron used for diagnosing and predicting the diabetes disease from the hepatic and lipid profile panel and choosing the most suitable method based on the accuracy of these algorithms. The research study essentially puts forward a novel approach to predict one disease from the markers of other related diseases. The dataset used in all the experiments mentioned in the paper has been collected from a medical center situated in Kashmir for a period of six months. Jupyter Notebook has been used as a data analytics tool and Python 3.7 as a programming language to perform all the experiments. The data for training and testing has been split into different ratios of 80:20 and 70:30. The observed results determine that the Random Forest algorithm attained the best accuracy of 82.72\% with only nine predictive attributes.},

  abstract = {In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz information criterion (also SIC, SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; models with lower BIC are generally preferred. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When fitting models, it is possible to increase the maximum likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. Both BIC and AIC attempt to resolve this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model; the penalty term is larger in BIC than in AIC for sample sizes greater than 7. The BIC was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz and published in a 1978 paper, as a large-sample approximation to the Bayes factor.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomic sequence data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analysis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, it is currently computationally expensive to perform hierarchical clustering of extremely large sequence datasets due to its quadratic time and space complexities. In this paper we developed a new algorithm called ESPRIT-Forest for parallel hierarchical clustering of sequences. The algorithm achieves subquadratic time and space complexity and maintains a high clustering accuracy comparable to the standard method. The basic idea is to organize sequences into a pseudo-metric based partitioning tree for sub-linear time searching of nearest neighbors, and then use a new multiple-pair merging criterion to construct clusters in parallel using multiple threads. The new algorithm was tested on the human microbiome project (HMP) dataset, currently one of the largest published microbial 16S rRNA sequence dataset. Our experiment demonstrated that with the power of parallel computing it is now compu- tationally feasible to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of tens of millions of sequences. The software is available at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/{$\sim$}yijunsun/lab/ESPRIT-Forest.html.},

  abstract = {Taxonomy-independent analysis plays an essential role in microbial community analysis. Hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational taxonomic units, the basis for many downstream analyses. Most existing algorithms have quadratic space and computational complexities, and thus can be used only for small or medium-scale problems. We propose a new online learning-based algorithm that simultaneously addresses the space and computational issues of prior work. The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of subspaces using a partition tree constructed using a pseudometric, then recursively refine a clustering structure in these subspaces. The technique relies on new methods for fast closest-pair searching and efficient dynamic insertion and deletion of tree nodes. To avoid exhaustive computation of pairwise distances between clusters, we represent each cluster of sequences as a probabilistic sequence, and define a set of operations to align these probabilistic sequences and compute genetic distances between them. We present analyses of space and computational complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm using a human gut microbiota data set with over one million sequences. The new algorithm exhibits a quasilinear time and space complexity comparable to greedy heuristic clustering algorithms, while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

  abstract = {Hopkins statistic (Hopkins and Skellam 1954) can be used to test for spatial randomness of data and for detecting clusters in data. Although the method is nearly 70 years old, there is persistent confusion regarding the definition and calculation of the statistic. We investigate the confusion and its possible origin. Using the most general definition of Hopkins statistic, we perform a small simulation to verify its distributional properties, provide a visualization of how the statistic is calculated, and provide a fast R function to correctly calculate the statistic. Finally, we propose a protocol of five questions to guide the use of Hopkins statistic.},
